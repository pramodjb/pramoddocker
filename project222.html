				 <br /><p class="a1">Sugar cane is a perennial grass that thrives well in tropical and frost-free warm
				temperate areas. It requires high temperatures, plenty of sunlight, large quantities of
				water (at least 1500 mm of rain per year unless grown with irrigation), fertile soils, and
				good drainage. The crop cycle varies between 10 and 24 months, but can be extended
				four times or more by additional ratoon cropping. Cane is harvested after 12 to 18
				months for most plant crops, after 12 months for ratoon crops.</p>
                <p>In modern, fully mechanized cultivation areas, as is the case in the US and Australia, the growing period
				may be considerably shorter, with plant cane harvested 9 months after spring
				emergence, and 7-8 months for ratoon crops. Harvesting is generally done in the dry
				period and when the stalks contain the maximum amount of sucrose.
				Sugar cane is a member of the grass family and is native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of Asia. They have stout, jointed, fibrous stalks, which look like bamboo cane. Sugar cane is the source of sugar in all tropical and subtropical countries of the world.Sugar canes can grow up to two to six meters tall.</p>

                    <h2>Soil management</h2>
                          <p class="a1"> Suitability of soil
                            Medium to fine textured, deep (depth > 1 m), rich in organic matter status,
                            well drained, having pH between 6.5 to 8.0 are ideal for sugarcane crop.
                            Growing sugarcane on coarse textured, shallow soils will result in poor yield.
                            The crop is sensitive to soil salinity and sodicity. Sugarcane crop does not suffer
                            as long as electrical conductivity of saturation extract of soil (ECe) is up to 1.7
                            millimhos/cm. Similarly exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of soil should
                            be less than 15% for better crop production. Quality of irrigation water (surface
                            and ground water) should necessarily be less than 1.5 millimhos/cm in its
                            electrical conductivity for irrigation of sugarcane crop on fine textured deep soils
                            under semi-arid conditions. Depth to ground water in sugarcane crop fields
                            should be more than 3 m.
                            2. Preparatory tillage
                            As sugarcane crop stands in field for more than a year, it is necessary to
                            give deep ploughing by iron mould board plough drawn by bullocks or tractor. If
                            preceding crop is a green manure crop, ploughing is not necessary as for burring
                            green manure crop ploughing is required. The proper time for ploughing is
                            immediately after the preceding crop is harvested or just after a good shower of
                            rain is received. The land is then exposed to atmosphere for a month or two and
                            then harrow is worked three to four times to break clods and to make the land
                            smooth and even. Before last harrowing, recommended dose of organic manure
                            is applied and mixed well with soil. Furrows at required distance depending
                            upon the spacing are then opened across the major slope.

				4.0 Ground Water scenario
				4.1.1 Occurrence of Ground Water
				Mandya district is covered by the geological formations ranging in age from
				Archaean, Granitic gneiss, Dharvar etc to recent alluvium. Various intrusive later
				traverse these formations. Based on the hydrogeological conditions in different rock
				types occurring in the district the entire district comes under hard rock area except for
				areas adjacent to the major streams and rivers where alluvium occurs as local pockets.
				The ground water occurs in the secondary porosity of weathered formations like granitic
				gneiss, granite and schists etc under water table conditions at shallow depth up to 25 m
				and generally under semi-confined to confined conditions in the jointed and fractured
				portions of the above rocks down to the depth of 200 m bgl. The ground water also
				occurs in the inter-granular spaces in the alluvial patches along the stream courses
				under water table conditions at shallow depth.
				Hydrogeological features are shown in fig -3
				The regional ground water flow systems of Mandya districts described under
				three zones as shallow, moderately deep, and deep zone.
				a) Shallow zone: The aquifers occurring within the depth of 25 m below ground
				level are constituted of weathered and fractured granite gneisses, granites and schist.
				Ground water occurs in the open spaces of weathered and fractured formations under
				water table conditions. Ground water of this zone is utilised through structures like dug
				wells, dug cum borewells and shallow borewells. In the 12% of the areas of the district
				the weathered zone thickness is less than 5 mts falling in parts of northeastern K.R.Pet,
				southwestern Nagamangala and north and western parts of Pandavapura taluks.In
				64% areas of the district the weathered thickness is in the range of 5 to 10 mts. In the
				remaining 24% areas of the district falling in parts of southern K.R.Pet, eastern Maddur,
				eastern Malavalli, small portion in eastern part of Nagamangala, southern part of
				Pandavapur and major part of S.R.Patna taluk the weathered thickness is more than
				10m.
				b) Moderately deep zone: The aquifers occurring within the depth of 50 m below
				ground levels are grouped in this category. The aquifers of this category constituted of
				weathered and fractured granite gneisses, granites and schist. Ground water occurs in
				the open spaces of weathered and fractured formations under semi-confined
				conditions.</p> <br />

              	<h2>Sugar cane Climate</h2>
         <p class="a1"> Sugarcane – a principal crop for biofuel – reduces the local air temperature compared to pasturelands or fields growing soybeans or maize, according to a new study from researchers at Stanford University and the Carnegie Institution for Science. But sugarcane's effect on temperature is a "double-edged machete," as it increases ambient temperatures compared with natural vegetation.
		These small local changes should be taken into consideration in studies of global climate change, the researchers said.
		The researchers looked at changes in vegetation in the Brazilian Cerrado – a vast tropical savanna lying south of the Amazon basin – large areas of which have been converted from natural vegetation to agriculture in recent decades.
		Increasingly, these existing agricultural areas are now being converted to sugarcane for use in biofuel production. Brazil is now second only to the United States in ethanol production, much of which is used domestically.

              	<h2>Cultivation process</h2>
              
              <p class="a1">Sugarcane cultivation and the sugar industry in India are facing
                serious challenges due to various internal and external factors.
                The reasons for such low productivity are:
                • The improved varieties released by research organizations
                perform well in the initial years but lose their vigour and decline
                in yield in due course.
                • Water availability is unpredictable. The concern is not only the
                quantity of water required, but also the lack of proper water
                management practices. Due to this, water is either wasted or
                sometimes not available at the right time.

                Source: Food Outlook, Global Market Analysis, Nov. 2008
                World Sugar Production Forecast (2008-09)
                • Unpredictable climatic aberrations, improper cultivation practices, negligence in plant
                protection measures, imbalanced nutrient management and other practices like mono
                cropping often result in low productivity, fetching low price in the market.
                In addition, it is also very important to consider the enormous amount of water that goes
                into the sugarcane production. Approximately 25,000 kg of water is needed to produce 10 kg
                of sugarcane.</p></div>

                            <h2>Fertilizers</h2>

                               <p class="a1"> Precautions to be taken while applying fertilizers
                            • Always fertilizers should be well mixed with soil and applied 4 – 5 cm deep in
                            the soil.
                            • Apply fertilizers when soil is moist. On the next day of fertilizer application,
                            give light irrigation.
                            • While applying Urea fertilizer, it should be mixed with Neem cake in 6 : 1
                            proportion.
                            • Mixing phosphatic fertilizers with compost or dung manure is beneficial.
                            • During periods of water stress, additional dose of 125 kg Muriate of potash
                            fertilizer should be applied.
                            • If green manure crop is planned, recommended dose of phosphorus for
                            sugarcane crop should be applied as below
                            25% dose to green manure crop
                            25% dose to sugarcane crop at planting
                            50% dose to sugarcane crop at earthing up.
                            • Soil test based fertilizer recommendations should be followed.
                            • In soils deficient with micro nutrients like iron, zinc, manganese, copper,
                            molybdenum and boron, in addition to above fertilizers, 25 kg Ferrous
                            Sulphate, 20 kg Zinc Sulphate, 10 kg Manganese Sulphate, 10 kg Copper
                            Sulphate 2.5 kg, Sodium Molybdate and 5 kg Borax per hectare should be
                            applied. Micro nutrient fertilizers should be mixed with well decomposed
                            dung manure or compost and applied as basal dose.</p></div>

                            <p class="a1">Now a days Sugar Cane Marketing rate is very low,per one ton only 700 or 750 rs.The world sugar market has been characterized by periods of shortlived
						price spikes followed by low and/or downward trending price patterns.
						This price behaviour emerges as a result of extensive use of protective policy
						measures by governments that isolate sugar producers from the world
						market. World sugar production, in raw equivalent, averaged 170 million
						tonnes between 2009/10 and 2012/13. Brazil was the world largest sugar
						producer and exporter accounting for 23 percent of world production and
						48 percent of global trade during the same period. It is a common belief
						that the significant production growth that occurred in Brazil since the 1990s
						was linked to a massive investment in technology both at the farm level -
						in terms of the adoption of high performing sugarcane clones - and at the
						factory level, with the conversion of sugarcane into ethanol. India is the
						second largest producer accounting for 15 percent of global output followed
						by the EU (10 percent), China (7 percent), Thailand (6 percent), United
						States (4 percent) and Mexico (3 percent). Africa accounted for 6.1 percent
						of world sugar output between 2009/10 and 2012/13, down from 7 percent
						in 1990/91-1994/95.
						World average sugar consumption between 2009/10 and 2012/13 was
						estimated at about 165 million tonnes, 26 percent larger than the previous
						decade. Growth in consumption has mostly taken place in the developing
						countries, driven by population and per capita GDP growth. Consumption
						in developed countries has been relatively stagnant because of already high
						levels per capita sugar consumption – 36 kg per caput in comparison to the
						world average of 24 Kg – and dietary shifts away from sweeteners have also
						contributed to slower sugar intake. Estimates for major sugar consuming
						countries reveal that industrial demand accounts for 68 percent in the EU,
						48 percent in Brazil, while it is about 60 percent in India and the United
						States. </p>
